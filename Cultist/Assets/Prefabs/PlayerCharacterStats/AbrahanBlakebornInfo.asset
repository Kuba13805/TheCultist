  charDesc: 'Were it not for the intercession of someone from above, he would probably
    serve as an example of how anyone striking a bargain with dark forces ends up.
    Abrahan, formerly a Belgram cultist, is now a retired and redeemed veteran of
    the White Ash. His past has made him someone from whom the occult has no secrets.
    Though he doesn''t look it, he''s adept at the new kind of magic used by the
    city''s higher-ups - electricity. However, this does not mean that traditional
    tools and methods are alien to him. With his eyesight, he chills the blood when
    the situation calls for it, which has made him the perfect acquisition for his
    former unit.
